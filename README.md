# Quantum Information and Computing
This repository is for the course of "Quantum Information and Computing" in university of Padova in the master degree of "Physics of data". In this course we had some exercises(homeworks) to solve quantum questions with the help of Fortran and then use Python as a compiler .
For the final project, I was working on q-state Potts model
